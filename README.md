## Project Background

This is a project where I display my knowledge of the new React that uses Contexts, Reducers and Material.ui. It is a simple app where a book title and writer can be added from a form page and those plus stored books are displayed on another. The Book List utilizes window.localStorage and Material.ui theming.<br />

## Design decisions

The app is written using Hooks (New React).
